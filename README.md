# Sevelte FPV
Basic first person camera mod for Gorilla Tag. It does not do anything else.

## Why does this even exist?
Some VR players want a first person camera without the extra menu packed full of features. This mod is for them. It is only the first person camera.

- Can be toggled with ``OnEnable()`` and ``OnDisable()``. Mainly for compatability for Computer Interface.
